## PROJECT TITLE

## **CUSTOMER SUBSCRIPTION DATA ANALYSIS FROM CAPSTONE** 

This project focuses on analyzing subscription data to uncover valuable insights into revenue performance across different plans, regions, and years. It analyzed customer subscription data to gain insights into revenue, subscription plans, regional distribution, customer behavior, and trends over time.

## PROPOSED INSIGHT

The primary objective of this analysis is to identify patterns in customer subscriptions, highlight areas of stability or decline, and recommend strategies for growth. By evaluating the performance of Basic, Standard, and Premium plans across multiple regions which include East, North, West, and South, and tracking trends over 2022 and 2023, the project provides a comprehensive view of how subscription plans are contributing to overall business performance.

Through this analysis, we aim to answer key business questions:

- Which subscription plans generate the highest revenue?
- How do different regions perform in terms of subscriptions and revenue growth?
- Are there signs of revenue decline or stagnation that need to be addressed?
- Which subscription type is most popular?
- What is customer's demand trend across regions?

This project showcases skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, and data visualization using tools like Power BI SQL and Microsoft Excel. 

It also includes recommendations based on the insights uncovered to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

The analysis and findings are documented in interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations to ensure clarity and impact. This project demonstrates proficiency in transforming raw subscription data into actionable insights, making it a valuable addition to any business intelligence portfolio.

## DATA SOURCES

The data used for this project was provided by the admin of the Ladies in Tech Initiative as part of a prerequisite project for advancing my analytical journey and fulfilling certification and mentorship requirements.

Key Observations:
Overall Revenue:

2022 Revenue: 40,538,438
2023 Revenue: 27,001,737
Grand Total: 67,540,175
Insight:

2022 contributed 60% of total revenue, while 2023 dropped to 40%. There’s a noticeable decline in revenue between the two years, which could indicate lower customer engagement, reduced subscriptions, or external market challenges.
Analysis of Subscription Categories:
FALSE Group (2022-2023):
Total Revenue: 23,720,255
Basic Plan Revenue: 16,967,285
East Region: 10,242,555
North Region: 6,724,730
Standard Plan (West Region): 6,752,970
Insight:

The East region is a key driver for the Basic plan revenue in 2022, but it did not grow into 2023. Both North and East regions maintain a steady performance, but without any noticeable increase between the years.
West region’s Standard plan revenue (6.75M) remains constant across the years, showing a stable but non-growing base.
TRUE Group (2022-2023):
Total Revenue: 16,818,183
Basic Plan (North Region): 3,365,221
Premium Plan (South Region): 10,126,800
Standard Plan (West Region): 3,326,162
Insight:

Premium Plan in the South region drives the majority of the TRUE category’s revenue, showing a concentration of high-value customers. This segment remains unchanged in 2023 with identical revenue, which may indicate that the customer base is consistent, but growth opportunities may be limited.
Basic plan in the North region remains stable, generating the same revenue across 2022 and 2023, highlighting a lack of churn but also no expansion.
Year-over-Year Trends (2022 vs 2023):
No growth was recorded across all the major segments and regions from 2022 to 2023. The Premium plan in the South region maintained 10.1M revenue in both years.
Standard plan in the West region stayed flat at 6.75M (FALSE) and 3.32M (TRUE) across both years.
The Basic plan in the North showed no revenue growth from 3.36M between 2022 and 2023.
Potential Issues and Opportunities:
Flat Growth Across Years:

Several segments remained unchanged in revenue from 2022 to 2023. This suggests no net new customers or reduced customer acquisition efforts in these regions and plans.
Focus on Premium Customers in South:

The Premium plan in South is a key revenue driver, but it didn’t grow between 2022 and 2023. There’s an opportunity to retain and upsell existing customers while expanding premium offerings.
Basic Plan Opportunities in East and North:

East and North regions generate significant revenue through Basic plans but lack growth. These regions may benefit from targeted marketing to drive subscription upgrades or cross-sell Standard/Premium plans.
West Region Stability:

The West region maintains stable performance across both Standard and Basic plans. This is good, but it indicates a need for innovation or new campaigns to drive growth.
Recommendations:
Targeted Growth Campaigns:

Focus marketing efforts in South and East regions to promote Premium subscriptions and increase revenue beyond current levels.
Churn Prevention & Customer Retention:

Launch customer loyalty programs for Basic and Standard plans to prevent churn and upsell into Premium offerings.
Data-Driven Insights:

Analyze customer behavior in regions with flat growth (West and North) to identify barriers to expansion. Use this insight to design new subscription tiers or incentives.
